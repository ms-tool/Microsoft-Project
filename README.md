## Installation

The latest stable release of Microsoft Project is version 2501. If you’re currently using a preview build of Microsoft Project 2501, ensure it’s removed before installing the final version. Keep in mind that installing Microsoft Project 2025 won’t automatically replace earlier versions, such as Project 2019 or older editions.

By proceeding with the installation process, you acknowledge and accept the [license agreement](*) and [privacy policy](*). To share feedback, request new features, or get support, visit the official [Microsoft Project Community site](*).

Please note that installing Microsoft Project 2501 won’t remove any existing installations, allowing you to operate multiple versions side by side. However, if a preview release of 2501 is installed, it must be uninstalled beforehand. To verify your current version, navigate to **Help** > **About Microsoft Project**.
